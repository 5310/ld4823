*	Rotation and swapping do not work together. I am doing NOTHING wrong, promise. 

	I can't tell if it's an actual bug, or something I still haven't notice, but swapping only works if planets cannot rotate. 
	EVERYTHING else works. But without rotation, the sort of gameplay I had planned is impossible. 
	
	GAMESTOPPER BUG. If you can fix this, progress. Otherwise, stop.
	


*	Draw at least six sets each with at least six pieces and one planet.

*	Implement randomly generating a number of planets with unique sets. 
	And then only randomly generating pieces from those sets, and that too to the maximum of six per set; duplication allowed.
	
*	Make sure the set-counting algorithm discounts empty pieces.

*	Implement a title/menu screen with blurb, brief help, and ability to restart with a new level: All mouse driven.

*	Add effects:
	
	*	Pieces shrink when planets are too close; as per their heights.
	
	*	Moving planets generate particle-trails.
	
	*	Successful collisions display visual feedback via particles.
