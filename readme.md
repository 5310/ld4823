Incomplete Ludum Dare #23 Entry
===============================

Gave up with five hours left when couldn't resolve local-rotation and normal bug for collisions. 

Engine runs, and can be salvaged for a rewrite. Repository for archival purposes now, since I don't feel very much inclined to rewrite it in lieu of other larger but more interesting ideas.

Another LD48 failure u_u, boo.

How to Run/Work
---------------

This is a LÖVE 0.8.0 project. To run, install LÖVE, and drop the root folder on top of it, or use the shell-scripts.
